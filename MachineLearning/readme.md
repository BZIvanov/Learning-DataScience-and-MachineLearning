# Machine learning (ML)

## Types of ML

- Supervised learning - applied to labled dataset, the ML model predicts a value. Supervised learning algorithms can be further classified into regression and classification tasks:
  - Regression - In regression tasks, the algorithm predicts a continuous numeric value as the output. For example, predicting the price of a house based on its features
  - Classification - In classification tasks, the algorithm assigns input data points to predefined categories or classes. For example, classifying emails as spam or non-spam based on their content
- Unsupervised learning - applied to unlabeled dataset, the ML model discovers possible patterns in the data. Unsupervised learning algorithms can be used for tasks such as:
  - Clustering
  - Dimensionality reduction
  - Anomaly detection
