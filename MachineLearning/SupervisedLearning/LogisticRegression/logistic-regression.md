# Logistic Regression

Logistic Regression is a statistical method used for binary classification tasks, where the goal is to predict the probability of an input belonging to one of two possible outcomes (e.g., yes or no, 0 or 1). It models the relationship between the input variables and the probability of the target variable using a logistic function, which maps the input values to the range of [0, 1]. The model estimates coefficients for each input variable to determine the likelihood of the target variable being in one class or the other.
