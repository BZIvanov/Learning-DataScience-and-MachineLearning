# Linear Regression (LR)

## Simple Linear Regressin

Simple linear regression equation

$${\hat{y} = {b_0} + {b_1}{x_1}}$$

where:

- $\hat{y}$ - dependent variable
- ${b_0}$ - y-intercept (constants)
- ${b_1}$ - slope coefficient
- ${x_1}$ - independent variable

## Regularization

Regularization is to solve a few common model issues by:

- minimizing model complexity
- reducing model overfitting
- penalizing the loss function

Types of regularization:

- L1
- L2
- Combining L1 and L2
