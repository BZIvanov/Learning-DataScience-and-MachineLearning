# Kernel Density Estimation (KDE)

Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) is a non-parametric statistical technique used to estimate the probability density function of a random variable. It involves placing a kernel, typically a Gaussian distribution, on each data point and summing them to create a smoothed density estimate. The bandwidth parameter determines the width of the kernels and affects the smoothness of the estimate. KDE provides a flexible and continuous representation of the underlying distribution, making it useful for visualizing data and estimating unknown probability distributions.
